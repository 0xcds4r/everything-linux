# About
Everything for Linux it's free and open-source software.

- The original Everything project for Windows has nothing to do with this project, apart from the idea.
- The author of this project greatly missed a proper search tool for Linux, so they decided to recreate something similar to Everything.
- The author plans to continue developing this project if they receive support from regular users.

The author of 'Everything for Linux' is 0xcds4r.
